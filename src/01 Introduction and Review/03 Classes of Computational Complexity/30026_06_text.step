In this small example, we can see there does indeed a solution that satisfies this formula (<span class=\"wysiwyg-font-tt\">x = TRUE</span> and <span class=\"wysiwyg-font-tt\">y = FALSE</span>), but is there way of algorithmically determining if a solution exists for some arbitrary Boolean formula?</p><p>The \"Boolean Satisfiability Problem\" is\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">NP-Complete</span></b>, meaning it is both\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">NP-Hard</span></b>\u00a0<i>and</i>\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">NP</span></b>.
