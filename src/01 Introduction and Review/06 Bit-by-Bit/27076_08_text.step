In decimal addition, we carry the one when a given column wraps around from a value of 9 to a value of 0 (because in decimal, the valid digits are 0-9, so incrementing 9 wraps around to 0). Identically, in binary addition, we carry the one when a given column wraps around from a value of 1 to a value of 0 (because in binary, the valid digits are 0-1, so incrementing 1 wraps around to 0).</p><p>Below is an example of the addition of two binary numbers:</p><p><span class=\"image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/6926b893-1dc2-4b61-b8ab-05f103d77c76/\" title=\"Image: https://ucarecdn.com/6926b893-1dc2-4b61-b8ab-05f103d77c76/\"></span></p><p>Note that the right column's addition was simply 1 + 0 = 1. Then, the next column to the left was simply 0 + 1 = 1. Then the next column was 1 + 1 = 10, so we put a value of 0 in that column and carry the 1. Lastly, the leftmost column was simply 0 + 0 = 0, plus the 1 we carried over, so we put a value of 1.</p>\n\n", "subtitle_files": [], "source": null, "animation": null, "video": null, "tests_archive": null, "options": {}, "subtitles": {}}, "time": "2017-02-14T23:12:09.076107"}
