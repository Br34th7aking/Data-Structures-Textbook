Although we must admit that using your computer's terminal for regular computer science tasks isn't quite as intense as \"hacking into the mainframe\" of some evil corporation, the terminal is still quite powerful.<br></p><p>In this day and age, we have become used to the \"point-and-click\" (or even simply \"touch\") nature of modern operating systems, but most large-scale computational tasks are done remotely via some compute server. Consequently, knowing how to use the Unix command line properly is vital.</p><p>In this section, you will learn the basics of how to navigate the Unix command line, and in addition to basic navigation, you will be introduced to some of the more powerful Unix tools built into most Unix-based operating systems. Beware that we will only be touching the surface in this course, and as with most computer-related things, one can only become truly comfortable using the terminal with practice, practice, practice.</p><p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/7f896b36-0a71-4c7e-a28b-e62719c66690/\" alt=\"\" title=\"Image: https://ucarecdn.com/7f896b36-0a71-4c7e-a28b-e62719c66690/\"></p><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><b>Figure:</b>\ufeff An example of the Unix Command Line<br></p>", "subtitle_files": [], "source": null, "animation": null, "video": null, "tests_archive": null, "options": {}, "subtitles": {}}, "time": "2017-02-14T23:12:19.342888"}
