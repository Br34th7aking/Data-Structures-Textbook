The safety checks built into Java slow down the execution of your code, but the lack of these safety checks in C++ means that, even if your code's logic is incorrect, you may still be allowed to execute it which can make debugging tricky.</p><p><b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">STOP and Think:</span></b> Based on the descriptions above, why would we use C++ instead of Java to implement data structures in this course?</p><p>In this chapter we assume you are familiar with programming in Java and C.\u00a0 The purpose of this chapter is to provide you with a <i>very basic</i> introduction to C++.\u00a0 For much more information, we recommend the following resources:</p><ul><li><i>C++ for Java Programmers </i>by Mark Allen Weiss</li><li>\ufeffThe C++ tutorial from the cplusplus.com site: <a href=\"http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/\" title=\"Link: http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/\">http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/</a>\ufeff\u00a0 In addition the whole <a href=\"http://www.cplusplus.com/\" title=\"Link: http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/\">http://www.cplusplus.com/</a> site \ufeffis an invaluable resource and language reference.\u00a0 You'll want to refer to it often.<br></li><li>\ufeffThe tutorialspoint C++ tutorial: <a href=\"http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/\" title=\"Link: http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/\">http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/</a></li><li>\ufeffThe Cprogramming.com C++ tutorial: \ufeff<a href=\"http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c++-tutorial.html\" title=\"Link: http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c++-tutorial.html\">http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c++-tutorial.html</a>\ufeff</li><li>The LearnCpp.com tutorial: <a href=\"http://www.learncpp.com/\">http://www.learncpp.com/</a>\ufeff\ufeff<br></li></ul>", "subtitle_files": [], "source": null, "animation": null, "video": null, "tests_archive": null, "options": {}, "subtitles": {}}, "time": "2017-06-08T22:30:24.496862"}
