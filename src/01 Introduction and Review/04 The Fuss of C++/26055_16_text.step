{"block": {"name": "text", "text": "<p>In summation, C++ is a very powerful, but very tricky, programming language. There are very few safety checks because the main priority of the language is speed, and it is up to you to ensure that your code is correct and safe.</p><p>In Java, if your code throws a runtime error, the Java Runtime Environment gives you very detailed information about where in your code the error occurred and what the error was. In C++, however, there is a very good chance that your runtime error will simply say <span class=\"wysiwyg-font-tt\">SEGMENTATION FAULT</span>. Many Java programmers who transition to C++ are frustrated with the lack of detail in C++ runtime errors in comparison to Java runtime errors, so if you fall into this boat, do not feel discouraged! Be sure to read up on how to debug your code using <span class=\"wysiwyg-font-tt\">gdb</span> as it will certainly come in handy when you work on the programming assignments.</p><p>Finally, as we mentioned at the start, this lesson provided only a very basic overview of C++.\u00a0 For more information, here are the resources we mentioned at the start of this lesson<i>:</i></p><ul><li><i>C++ for Java Programmers </i>by Mark Allen Weiss</li>\r\n<li>The C++ tutorial from the cplusplus.com site: <a href=\"http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/</a>\u00a0 In addition the whole <a href=\"http://www.cplusplus.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cplusplus.com/</a> site is an invaluable resource and language reference.
