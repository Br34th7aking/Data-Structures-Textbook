{"block": {"name": "text", "text": "<h2>Welcome to <i>Data Structures</i>!</h2><p>This interactive textbook was written with the intention of teaching Computer Science students about various data structures as well as the applications in which each data structure would be appropriate to use.</p><p>This textbook utilizes the Active Learning approach to instruction, meaning it has various activities embedded throughout to help stimulate your learning and improve your understanding of the materials we will cover. You will encounter <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">STOP and Think</span></b> questions that will help you reflect on the material, <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Exercise Breaks</span></b> that will test your knowledge and understanding of the concepts discussed, and <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">Code Challenges</span></b> that will allow you to actually implement some of the algorithms we will cover.</p><p>Note that the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">Code Challenges</span></b> are meant to be done in C++, meaning it is a good idea to familiarize yourself with C++ syntax prior to beginning this textbook. One useful online resource is the <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/free-learn-c-tutorial-beginners/\" rel=\"nofollow\">C++ Tutorial for Complete Beginners</a> course on the Udemy platform. However, to cater to the increasing use of Python, we have also created Python versions of the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">Code Challenges</span></b> as well.</p><p>Also note that the emphasis of this textbook is on <i>theory</i>, which is language-agnostic, so even without C++ or Python experience, you will still be able to take away the important points we discuss.<br></p><p>Happy learning!</p><p><a href=\"http://niema.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Niema Moshiri</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizizhikevich\" rel=\"nofollow\">Liz Izhikevich</a></p>", "video": null, "animation": null, "options": {}, "subtitle_files": [], "source": null, "subtitles": {}, "tests_archive": null, "feedback_correct": "", "feedback_wrong": ""}, "id": "110111", "time": "2018-03-04T14:34:44.339888"}
