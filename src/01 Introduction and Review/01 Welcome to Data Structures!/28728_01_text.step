You will encounter\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">STOP and Think</span></b> questions that will help you reflect on the material,\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Exercise Breaks</span></b>\u00a0that will test your knowledge and understanding of the concepts discussed, and\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">Code Challenges</span></b>\u00a0that will allow you to actually implement some of the algorithms we will cover.</p><p>Note that the\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">Code Challenges</span></b> are in C++, meaning it is a good idea to familiarize yourself with C++ syntax prior to beginning this textbook. One useful online resource is the <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/free-learn-c-tutorial-beginners/\">C++ Tutorial for Complete Beginners</a> course on the Udemy platform. However, also note that the emphasis of this textbook is on\u00a0<i>theory</i>, which is language-agnostic, so even without C++ experience, you will still be able to take away the important points we discuss. <br></p><p>Happy learning!</p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://niema.net/\">Niema Moshiri</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizizhikevich\">Liz Izhikevich</a></p>", "subtitle_files": [], "source": null, "animation": null, "video": null, "tests_archive": null, "options": {}, "subtitles": {}}, "time": "2017-02-14T23:11:05.213879"}
