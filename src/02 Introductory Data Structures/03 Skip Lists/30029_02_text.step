For our purposes, we will denote the number of layers a node reaches as its <i>height</i>.\u00a0The very bottom layer is exactly a regular\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Linked List</span></b>, and each higher layer acts as an \"express lane\" for the layers below. Also, the elements in a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Skip List</span></b> must be\u00a0<b>sorted</b>. The sorted property of the elements in a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Skip List</span></b> will let us perform a find algorithm that is functionally similar to binary search.\u00a0Below is an example of a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Skip List</span></b>:</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/af5d2e1d-a7d7-4af0-9355-6c2725f4f49d/\"></p><p>Just like with a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Linked List</span></b>, we have a\u00a0<i>head</i>. However, because\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Skip Lists</span></b> have\u00a0<i>multiple</i> layers, the\u00a0<i>head</i> also has multiple layers. Specifically, for each layer\u00a0<i>i</i>, the\u00a0<i>i</i>-th pointer in\u00a0<i>head</i> points to the first node that has a height of\u00a0<i>i</i>. In the example above, the first node (1) happens to reach every layer, so each pointer in\u00a0<i>head</i> points to 1, but this does not have to be the case. Take the example below:</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/4e97db37-7f47-47ca-ae3c-96d810c06009/\" title=\"Image: https://ucarecdn.com/4e97db37-7f47-47ca-ae3c-96d810c06009/\"></p><p>Now, the three pointers in\u00a0<i>head</i> point to three different nodes. For our purposes, we will number the bottom layer as layer 0, the next layer as layer 1, etc. In this example,\u00a0<i>head</i>'s pointer in layer 0 points to node 1, its pointer in layer 1 points to node 3, and its pointer in layer 2 points to node 5.</p><p>In this example, nodes 1, 2, and 4 have heights of 0, node 3 has a height of 1, and node 5 has a height of 2.</p>", "subtitle_files": [], "source": null, "animation": null, "video": null, "tests_archive": null, "options": {}, "subtitles": {}}, "time": "2017-02-14T23:13:11.927147"}
