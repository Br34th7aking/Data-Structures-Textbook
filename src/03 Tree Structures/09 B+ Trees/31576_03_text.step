Note that the internal nodes outlined in <b>black</b> are filled with <i>keys</i> (i.e., the integers we use to sort the tree), and the nodes outlined in <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">purple</span></b> are the leaves filled with <i>all</i> the data records. Consequently, you will notice that some integers are repeated twice within the <b> <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">B+ Tree</span></b> (e.g. there are two instances of the key 7: one is a <i>key</i> and another is a data record).\u00a0</p><p>Also, note that we are using integer values to sort the tree <i>and</i> we are storing the integer values themselves. As a result, the\u00a0<i>keys</i> are equal to the\u00a0<i>data records</i>. However, if we were inserting large database entries, then the data records in the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">purple</span></b> boxes would contain more information other than just the integer value.</p><p><img height=\"268\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/884bf22a-77b8-4ad6-ae54-c4d5ab630328/\"></p><p><b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">STOP and Think: </span></b>Can you see how the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">purple</span></b> data records are sorted in the <b> <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">B+ Tree</span></b> above?</p><p><b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Note:</span></b> Hopefully you have noticed that the<b> <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">B+ Tree</span></b> that we introduced <i>technically </i>violates one of the fundamental properties of a <b>tree</b>: the green Linked List arrows cause undirected cycles to appear in the \"<b>tree</b>.\" As a result, this presents a bit of a conundrum because, on the one hand, the<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\"> B+ Tree</span></b> that is used <i>in practice</i> to <i>actually</i> implement databases really does use the Linked List structure at the bottom.

Well, since we have agreed to talk about <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">B+\u00a0</span><i><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Trees</span>,\u00a0</i></b>for this lesson and for the purpose of this text, we are going to omit the Linked List structure at the leaves in order to keep a <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\"><b>B+\u00a0</b></span><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\"><b>Tree</b></span> a valid <b>tree</b>. Do keep in mind, however, that in practice, it is common for people to still refer to using a \"<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">B+ Tree</span></b>\" structure to implement their database <i>with</i> the use of the Linked List leaf structure.\u00a0<br></p>", "video": null, "animation": null, "options": {}, "subtitle_files": [], "source": null, "subtitles": {}, "tests_archive": null, "feedback_correct": "", "feedback_wrong": ""}, "id": "123117", "time": "2017-11-07T22:21:20.093122"}
