In order to still be able to traverse the tree, however, our keys above the leaves would be kept for storing <i>only</i> the single field we used to <i>sort</i> the data records. That way, we get to traverse <i>smaller</i>\n nodes to reach the query. By having less data to traverse, we would increase our chances that the smaller key nodes are stored <i>closer to <b>each other</b></i> in memory, thereby making it more likely that they are in a <i>closer <b>section of memory</b></i>, such as the L1 Cache  (remember, this is because the CPU determines which data to put in closer sections of memory largely based on<i><b> spatial</b></i>\n locality). By having the keys be in a closer section of memory, it will\n thus take less time to access the queried database entry. <br></li><li>Now\n that we have all the full data records guaranteed to be at the leaves, \nlet's take advantage of this situation to create an easier way to read \nall the data entries <i>without</i> having to traverse up and down the \ntree; let's link together all the leaf nodes (i.e., implement the leaf \nnodes as a Linked List)! That way, we can just do a linear scan of our \nleaf nodes to read <i>all</i> of our database entries.<br></li></ol>The implementation of the two ideas above in the   <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\"><b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">B-Tree</span></b></span> structure produces a modified structure called the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">B+ Tree</span></b>.
