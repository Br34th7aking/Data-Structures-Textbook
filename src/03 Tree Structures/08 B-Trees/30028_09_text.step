Within each node, we can do a binary search to find the element, which is O($ log_{2}b $). Thus, the worst-case time to find an element simplifies to O($ log\\ n\u00a0 $). However, what is the worst-case time complexity of the find operation<i> with respect to memory access</i>? At each level of the tree, we need to read in the entire node of size O(<i>b).</i> Consequently, the worst-case time to find an element is equal to\u2003O($b\\ log_{b}\\ n $). <br></p>", "subtitle_files": [], "source": null, "animation": null, "video": null, "tests_archive": null, "options": {}, "subtitles": {}}, "time": "2017-01-05T20:10:15.984881"}
