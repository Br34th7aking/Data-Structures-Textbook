On the one hand, as a graph, it violates some of the constraints listed above and thus should not be considered a tree. On the other hand, we explicitly called it a valid tree data structure previously because it represents a tree data structure containing 0 elements, which is valid. What is the correct verdict? For the purposes of this text, since we are focusing on data structures and not on graph algorithms specifically, let's explicitly handle this edge case and just say that a 0-node graph is a valid tree, despite the fact that it fails some of the above conditions.</p><p><b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">STOP and Think:</span></b> Which of the above conditions are violated by the empty tree?</p><p></p>", "subtitle_files": [], "source": null, "animation": null, "video": null, "tests_archive": null, "options": {}, "subtitles": {}}, "time": "2017-06-08T22:33:22.467846"}
