This algorithm, assuming we used <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Union-by-Height</span></b> or <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Union-by-Size</span></b> to construct our Up-Tree, has a worst-case time complexity of <b>O(log </b><i><b>n</b></i><b>)</b>.

The answer lies in taking advantage of <i>all</i> of the information we obtain during the \"find\" algorithm: not just the sentinel node of interest</span></span><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">.\u00a0</span></span></p><p>Take a look at the example disjoint set below:</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/d7121e7f-6d71-44a0-809b-2eb5b4061efb/\"></p><p>Suppose we want to perform find(A). We know that the goal of \"find\" is to return the sentinel node of vertex A (which is vertex C, in this case). Notice, however, that <i>every </i>vertex on our exploration path (vertex A, vertex B, and vertex F) have vertex C as their sentinel nodes, not just vertex A! As a result, it is unfortunate that, in the process of finding vertex A, we have gained the information that vertex B and vertex F also share the same root (which would save us time later if we wanted to find(B) or find(F)), yet we have no way of easily and efficiently memorizing this information... Or do we?\u00a0</p><p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">It turns out that we actually do! The solution is as follows: As we traverse the tree to return the sentinel node, we re-attach each vertex along the way directly to the root.

This is because we guarantee that since the vertex is attached directly to the root, we will only need one operation to return the root.
