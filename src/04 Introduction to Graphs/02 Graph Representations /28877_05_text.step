We can replace the \"1\"s in the matrix with the actual costs of the edges. The only other thing we would also need to worry about is how to define a \"no edge.\" At first glance, it might be tempting to just assume that we can always keep a \"0\" value as NULL. However, in general, it is perfectly valid for edges\n to have a weight of 0 and thus it is up to the person implementing the matrix to make the appropriate decision as to which NULL value to choose.\u00a0</p><p><span>Below is an example where we took the graph and adjacency matrix from the previous step and added some costs to all the edges. \ufeff</span></p><span class=\"image-wrapper\"><img title=\"Image: https://ucarecdn.com/54e1392b-1119-4228-a8a6-d6a27a7dd2e2/\" src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/54e1392b-1119-4228-a8a6-d6a27a7dd2e2/\"></span>", "video": null, "animation": null, "options": {}, "subtitle_files": [], "source": null, "subtitles": {}, "tests_archive": null, "feedback_correct": "", "feedback_wrong": ""}, "id": "117787", "time": "2017-11-07T22:21:46.670862"}
