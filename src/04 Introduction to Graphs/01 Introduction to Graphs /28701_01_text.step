As computers became more and more commonplace, services like MapQuest and later Google Maps were developed, which allowed individuals to obtain and print out turn-by-turn directions to reach their destinations. However, the moment you veered off the exact path laid out for you, it was often difficult to figure out how to get back on track. Technology advanced even further, leading to the development of portable GPS devices, which allowed for turn-by-turn directions that could be generated in real-time, and if you veered off the initial path, they would be able to generate updated directions for you on the fly. Now, we've reached a point where even portable GPS devices are obsolete, as most people are able to navigate themselves using their cell phones.</p><p>Clearly, navigation systems are essential for transportation, but how do these systems actually work under the hood? You enter a starting location and a destination, and you are magically given turn-by-turn directions for the shortest path connecting these two locations; so what's really going on behind the scenes? In this chapter, we will discuss <b>Graphs</b>, the data structures that allow for our beloved navigation systems to function.</p>", "subtitle_files": [], "source": null, "animation": null, "video": null, "tests_archive": null, "options": {}, "subtitles": {}}, "time": "2017-01-05T20:10:36.106861"}
