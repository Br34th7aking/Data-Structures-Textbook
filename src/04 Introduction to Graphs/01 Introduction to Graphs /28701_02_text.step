{"block": {"name": "text", "text": "<p>Let's take our original idea about navigation and generalize it somewhat: let's imagine that we're given a set of \"locations\" (which we will refer to as <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">nodes</span></b>) and a set of \"connections\" between these locations (which we will refer to as <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">edges</span></b>). If we are looking at the original navigation idea, the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">nodes</span></b> would be building addresses as well as street intersections, and the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">edges</span></b> would be streets connecting the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">nodes</span></b>. If we are looking instead at flights to various places in the world, where we want to find the shortest series of flights that will get us from one airport to another, the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">nodes</span></b> would be airports, and the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">edges</span></b> would be flights that connect airports. \n\nIf we are instead looking at data packets that we need to send between ports in a network, the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">nodes</span></b> would be ports and the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">edges</span></b> would be network connections between ports.\u00a0With this generalization of <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">nodes</span></b> and <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">edges</span></b>, the applications of our navigation idea are endless.</p><p>The following images were obtained from <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://openflights.org/\">OpenFlights</a>.
