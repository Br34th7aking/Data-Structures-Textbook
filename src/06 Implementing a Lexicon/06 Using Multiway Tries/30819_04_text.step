{"block": {"name": "text", "text": "<p>To <b>remove</b> a word, simply follow the find algorithm. If the find algorithm fails, the word does not exist in the trie, meaning nothing has to be done. If the find algorithm succeeds, simply remove the \"word node\" label from the node at which the find algorithm terminates. In the example below, we remove the word \"ate\" from the trie above by simply traversing the path spelled by \"ate\" and removing the \"word node\" label from the final node on the path:</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/720cb00f-7b83-48a8-a763-1941aca10584/\"></p>", "video": null, "animation": null, "options": {}, "subtitle_files": [], "source": null, "subtitles": {}, "tests_archive": null, "feedback_correct": "", "feedback_wrong": ""}, "id": "123377", "time": "2018-03-04T14:41:54.787157"}
