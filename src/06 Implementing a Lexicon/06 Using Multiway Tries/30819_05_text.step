If, at any point, the edge we need to traverse does not exist, simply create the edge (and node to which it should point), and continue.

Although this fact is quite clear given the diagrams, students often make mistakes when implementing\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Multiway Tries</span></b> in practice. Specifically, note that an \"empty\"\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Multiway Trie</span></b> (i.e., a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Multiway Trie</span></b> with no keys) is a\u00a0<b>single-node tree with no edges</b>. Then, if I were to insert even a single-letter key ('a' in the example below), I would create a\u00a0<i>second</i>\ufeff node, and 'a' would label the edge connecting my root node and this new node:</p><p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/d54c4e7a-ee9a-4247-99a4-a3221eb5e06c/\"></p>", "video": null, "animation": null, "options": {}, "subtitle_files": [], "source": null, "subtitles": {}, "tests_archive": null, "feedback_correct": "", "feedback_wrong": ""}, "id": "123378", "time": "2017-11-07T22:25:32.642946"}
