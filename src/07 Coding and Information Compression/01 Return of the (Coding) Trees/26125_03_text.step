{"block": {"name": "text", "text": "<p>We can represent the trivial example code mapping as well as any other character-based code mapping using a tree, called a <b>coding tree</b>. In this tree, edges are labeled by \"code\" symbols, and the \"non-coded\" symbols label the leaves. A non-coded symbol (i.e., a leaf in the coding tree) is encoded by the \"code\" symbols labeling the edges in the path from the root to the non-coded symbol.
