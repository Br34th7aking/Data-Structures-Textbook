However, we calculated an alarmingly high collision probability of 77.8% with that construction.

Using the equations from the previous steps, we see the following for various values of\u00a0<i>N</i> individuals:</p><div><ul><li>For <i>N</i>=10, $P_{N,M}(\\ge 1\\ collision) = 12\\%$\u00a0</li><li>For <i>N</i>=20, $P_{N,M}(\\ge 1\\ collision) = 41\\%$\u00a0</li><li>For <i>N</i>=30, $P_{N,M}(\\ge 1\\ collision) = 71\\%$\u00a0</li><li>For <i>N</i>=40, $P_{N,M}(\\ge 1\\ collision) = 89\\%$\u00a0</li><li>For <i>N</i>=50, $P_{N,M}(\\ge 1\\ collision) = 97\\%$\u00a0</li><li>For <i>N</i>=60, $P_{N,M}(\\ge 1\\ collision) = 99$+$\\%$\u00a0</li></ul><p>So, among 60 randomly-selected people, it is almost certain that at least one pair of them will have the same birthday. That is crazy! The fraction $\\frac{60}{365}$ is a mere $16.44\\%$, which is how full our <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Table</span></b>\u00a0of birthdays needed to be in order to have almost guaranteed a collision. How can we use this intuition to help us build a<b> <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Table</span></b> that minimizes the number of collisions?<br></p></div>", "subtitle_files": [], "source": null, "animation": null, "video": null, "tests_archive": null, "options": {}, "subtitles": {}}, "time": "2017-06-08T22:37:10.788395"}
