As you may have noticed, there are multiple events we need to take into account (the <i>first</i> <b>and</b> <i>second</i> key not facing a collision upon insertion) in order to figure out the\u00a0<i>overall</i> probability of a collision not happening, and that these events are <i>conditional</i>: the outcome of earlier events affects the probabilities of later events. To refresh your memory about conditional probabilities, if we have two events <i>A</i> and\u00a0<i>B</i> (dependent or independent: doesn't matter), we can compute the probability of <i>both</i> events occurring like so:</p><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">$ P(A\\ and\\ B) = P(A)P(B \\mid A) = P(B)P(A \\mid B) $\u00a0</p><p>Hopefully you can see that we are dealing with\u00a0<i>conditional probabilities</i>: when we attempt to calculate the probability that the\u00a0<i>i</i>-th key doesn't face a collision, we assume that each of the previous\u00a0<i>i</i>\u20131 keys did not face collisions when they were inserted. Formally:</p><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\">$ P_{N,M}(no\\ collision) = P_{N,M}(1^{st}\\ key\\ no\\ collision)*P_{N,M}(2^{nd}\\ key\\ no\\ collision \\mid 1^{st}\\ key\\ no\\ collision)... $\u00a0<br></p><p>If you are \nuncomfortable with this notion of <i>conditional probability</i>\u00a0or with basic probability in general, we \nrecommend that you read<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/probability-events-conditional.html\"> this </a>before you move on.</p><p>Using the equation above:\u00a0$ P_{N,M}(no\\ collision)=1\u2217\\frac{M\u22121}{M}\u2217\\frac{M\u22122}{M}...\\frac{M\u2212N+1}{M} $\u00a0<br></p><p>We can therefore conclude that\u00a0$ P_{2,1}(\u22651\\ collision)=1\u2212P_{N,M}(no\\ collision)=1\u2212(1\u22170)=1 $ or <i>100%.</i></p>Let us now turn to a more complicated example in the next step. <br>", "video": null, "animation": null, "options": {}, "subtitle_files": [], "source": null, "subtitles": {}, "tests_archive": null, "feedback_correct": "", "feedback_wrong": ""}, "id": "121798", "time": "2017-09-11T11:49:16.447429"}
