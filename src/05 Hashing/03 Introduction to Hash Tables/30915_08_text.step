Why? Because keys are <b>not</b> sorted in this data structure! This is very different from a lot of the data structures that we have discussed so far (such as Binary Search Trees) in which we maintained an ordering property at all times.</p><p>So, in the example given in the previous step, if we were to iterate through the keys in our <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Table</span></b>, we would expect the output to be \"F B N.\"</p><p>What if we were to insert the numbers 1-4 in an arbitrary <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Table</span></b>? Could we then expect the keys to be in sorted order? The answer is no! Why? Because we have no clue exactly what hash value the underlying\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">hash function</span></b> is producing in order to map the key to an index. For example, if <i>H</i>(<i>k</i>) = 2<i>\u1d4f</i> % <i>M</i>,\u00a0then we would expect to see the following:</p><p><span class=\"image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/199ccab3-275d-4655-8130-1b45b301b77e/\" alt=\"\" title=\"Image: https://ucarecdn.com/199ccab3-275d-4655-8130-1b45b301b77e/\"></span></p><p>You might be wondering why we would even be using a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">hash function</span></b> as complicated as <i>H</i>(<i>k</i>) = 2<i>\u1d4f</i> % <i>M</i>, and you might suspect that we're just being unrealistic for the sake of argument.
