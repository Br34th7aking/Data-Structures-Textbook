Then, throughout this chapter, we introduced the\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Table</span></b>, a data structure that, on average, performs\u00a0<i>extremely fast</i> (i.e., constant-time) find, insert, and remove operations.</p><p>However, what if we wanted to push further than simply storing\u00a0<i>keys</i>? For example, if we were to teach a class and wanted to store the students' names, we could represent them as strings and store them in a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Table</span></b>, which would allow us to see if a student is enrolled in our class in constant time. However, what if we wanted to\u00a0<i>also</i> store the students' grades? In other words, we can already query a student's name against our <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Table</span></b> and receive \"true\" or \"false\" if the student is in our table or not, but what if we want to instead return the student's grade?</p><p>The functionality we have described, in which we query a\u00a0<i>key</i> and receive a\u00a0<i>value</i>, is defined in the\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">Map</span> ADT</b>, which we will formally describe very soon. After discussing the\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">Map</span> ADT</b>, we will introduce a data structure that utilizes the techniques we used in\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Tables</span></b> to\u00a0<i>implement</i> the\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">Map</span> ADT</b>: the\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Hash Map</span></b>.</p><p></p><p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\"><b>Sad Fact: </b></span>Most people do not know the difference between a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Table</span></b> and a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Hash Map</span></b> and as a result they use the terms interchangeably, so beware! As you will learn, though a <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\"><b>Hash Map</b></span> is built on the same <i>premise</i> as a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Table</span></b>, it is a bit different and arguably more convenient in day-to-day programming.</p><p><b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Note:</span></b> If you have experience programming in Python and have used a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries\">Python dictionary</a>, then congratulations!
