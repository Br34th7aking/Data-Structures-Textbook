In the process of learning about the\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Table</span></b>, we discussed various properties and design choices (both in the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Table</span></b> itself as well as in\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">hash functions</span></b> for objects we may want to store)\u00a0that can help ensure that we actually experience the constant-time performance on average.</p><p>We then decided we wanted even <i>more</i> than simply <i>storing</i> elements: we decided we wanted to be able to <i>map</i> objects to other objects (map\u00a0<i>keys</i> to\u00a0<i>values</i>, specifically),\u00a0which led us to the\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">Map</span> ADT</b>. Using our prior knowledge of <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Tables</span></b>, we progressed to the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Hash Map</span></b>, an\u00a0extremely fast implementation of the <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\"><b>Map</b></span><b> ADT</b>.</p><p>In practice, the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Table</span></b> and the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Hash Map</span></b> are arguably two of the most useful data structures you will encounter in daily programming: the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Table</span></b> allows us to store our data and the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Hash Map</span></b> allows us to easily cluster our data, both with great performance.</p>", "subtitle_files": [], "source": null, "animation": null, "video": null, "tests_archive": null, "options": {}, "subtitles": {}}, "time": "2017-01-05T20:13:04.129734"}
