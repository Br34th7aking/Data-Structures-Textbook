However, the remove algorithm for <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Double Hashing</span></b> and for <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">Random Hashing</span></b> still turn out to be as wasteful as for <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Linear Probing</span></b>, so we still have to worry about reinserting elements into the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Table</span></b> periodically to clean up the \"delete\" flags.
