{"block": {"name": "text", "text": "<p>More formally, <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Cuckoo Hashing</span></b> is defined as having two <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\"><b>hash functions</b></span>, $ H_1(k) $  and $ H_2(k) $, both of which return a position in the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Table</span></b>. As a result, one key has strictly two different hashing locations, where $ H_1(k)$ is the first location that a key always maps to (but doesn't necessarily always stay at). A simplified version of <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Cuckoo Hashing</span></b> can be seen in the animation below. We will see in the next step that the algorithm traditionally uses two <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Tables</span></b>, but for now, this simplified version uses just one. Use the arrows in the bottom left to walk through the slides.</p><p><iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Vudjqz22KtPojqch780DLrYulqrXVSWXWVygtkOm3GI/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=60000\" width=100% height=\"550\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>", "video": null, "animation": null, "options": {}, "subtitle_files": [], "source": null, "subtitles": {}, "tests_archive": null, "feedback_correct": "", "feedback_wrong": ""}, "id": "121736", "time": "2018-03-04T14:40:58.949476"}
