If you don't remember all of the fancier Unix commands off the top of your head, that's perfectly fine. You can always search Google if you have a specific problem you need to solve, and StackOverflow is always your friend on that front.</p><p>If you are still not comfortable with the Unix command line, as we mentioned before, the best way to learn is to practice. For more practice, we suggest installing a Linux distribution onto a virtual machine via <a title=\"Link: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads\" href=\"https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads\">VirtualBox</a> (a great tutorial on how to install Ubuntu, one of the more user-friendly Linux distributions, using VirtualBox can be found in <a title=\"Link: http://askubuntu.com/questions/142549/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-virtualbox\" href=\"http://askubuntu.com/questions/142549/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-virtualbox\">this post in the Ubuntu support forums</a>). If you end up really enjoying Linux and want to use it as one of your main Operating Systems on your computer (as opposed to through a virtual machine on top of your main Operating System), you might even want to think about dual-booting your main Operating System with Ubuntu (or whatever Linux distribution you prefer).</p>", "options": {}, "subtitle_files": [], "name": "text", "video": null, "feedback_wrong": ""}, "id": "114888"}
