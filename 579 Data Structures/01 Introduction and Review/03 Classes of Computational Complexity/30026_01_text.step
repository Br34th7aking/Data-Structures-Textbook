Note that, however, algorithms are simply <i>solutions</i>\u00a0to <i>computational problems</i>. A single computational problem can have numerous algorithms as solutions. As a simple example, say my computational problem is the following: \"Given a vector containing <i>n</i>\u00a0integers, return the largest element\". Below is one algorithmic solution:\n\n<br></p><p></p><pre><code class=\"cpp\">int getMax1(vector&lt;int&gt; vec) {\n    int max = vec[0];\n    for(int i : vec) {\n        if(i &gt; max) {\n            max = i;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p></p><p>Below is a second algorithmic solution that is equally correct, but that is clearly less efficient (and more convoluted):</p><p></p><pre><code class=\"cpp\">int getMax2(vector&lt;int&gt; vec) {\n    for(int i : vec) {\n        bool best = true;\n        for(int j : vec) {\n            if(i &lt; j) {\n                best = False;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        if(best) {\n            return i;\n        }\n    }\n}</code></pre><p></p><p>As we can deduce, the first algorithm has a time complexity of O(<i>n</i>), whereas the second algorithm has a time complexity of O(<i>n</i>\u00b2). We were able to describe the two\u00a0<i>algorithms</i> (getMax1 and getMax2), but is there some way we can describe the\u00a0<i>computational problem</i> itself?</p><p>In this section, we will be discussing the main classes of computational problems:\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">P</span></b>,\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">NP</span></b>,\n\n<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">NP-Hard</span></b>, and\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">NP-Complete</span></b>.</p>", "subtitle_files": [], "source": null, "animation": null, "video": null, "tests_archive": null, "options": {}, "subtitles": {}}, "time": "2016-09-02T19:32:11.008847"}
