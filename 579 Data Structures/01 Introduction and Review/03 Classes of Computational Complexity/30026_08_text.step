What if, however,\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">P</span></b> wasn't just a subset of\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">NP</span></b>? What if\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">P</span></b> and\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">NP</span></b> were actually equal sets? This question of whether or not\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">P</span></b> equals\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">NP</span></b> is known as the \"<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">P</span></b> vs.\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">NP</span></b> Problem\", which is a major unsolved problem in the field of computer science. Informally, it\u00a0asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer.</p><p>Formally, if it can be mathematically proven that\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">P</span> = <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">NP</span></b>, then it would imply\u00a0<i>all</i> problems that can be verified in polynomial time can also be solved in polynomial time. Thus, if there is no known algorithmic solution to a problem that can be verified in polynomial time, we can conclude that a solution\u00a0<i>must</i> exist, and humans just have not found the solution yet.</p><p>On the other side, if it can be mathematically proven that\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">P</span>\u00a0\u2260 <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">NP</span></b>, then it would imply that there indeed exists a set of problems that can be verified in polynomial time but that cannot be solved in polynomial time. If we run into a problem in\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">NP</span></b> for which we cannot find a polynomial time solution, it very well could be that no such solution exists.</p><p>Below is a diagram representing the relationship between\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">P</span></b>,\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">NP</span></b>,\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">NP-Hard</span></b>, and\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">NP-Complete</span></b>\u00a0under both possible scenarios regarding the equality (or lack thereof) of\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">P</span></b> and\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">NP</span></b>.</p><p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/12483788-925a-493c-a227-751ea01f54d2/\" title=\"Image: https://ucarecdn.com/12483788-925a-493c-a227-751ea01f54d2/\"></p>", "feedback_correct": "", "tests_archive": null, "subtitles": {}, "source": null, "name": "text", "video": null, "feedback_wrong": "", "options": {}, "animation": null}}
