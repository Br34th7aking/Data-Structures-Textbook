We can take a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">pseudo</span>-random number generator</b> and\u00a0<i>seed</i> it with a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">true</span> random number</b>! The result is a sequence of random numbers that can be generated quickly, but that changes upon each execution of our program.</p><p>For example, let's say that we have a program that outputs a sequence of random numbers using a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">pseudo</span>-random number generator</b>, but seeded with some natural <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">true</span> random number</b> (e.g. thermal noise in the computer circuitry). If we ran the program yesterday, it would have measured some amount of thermal noise (let's call it <i>x</i>), then it would have seeded the\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">pseudo</span>-random number generator</b> with\u00a0<i>x</i>, and then it would have outputted a sequence of random numbers. If we then run the same program today, it would measure some amount of thermal noise that would be\u00a0<i>different</i> from yesterday's thermal noise (let's call it\u00a0<i>y</i>), then it would seed the\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">pseudo</span>-random number generator</b> with\u00a0<i>y</i>\u00a0(instead of\u00a0<i>x</i>), and it would generate an entirely different sequence of random numbers! Also, even though we still have to generate a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">true</span> random number</b>, which is slow, because we only have to generate a\u00a0<i>single</i>\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">true</span> random number</b>, and not an entire sequence of them, it is fast enough.</p>", "subtitle_files": [], "source": null, "animation": null, "video": null, "tests_archive": null, "options": {}, "subtitles": {}}, "time": "2016-09-07T23:32:49.118502"}
