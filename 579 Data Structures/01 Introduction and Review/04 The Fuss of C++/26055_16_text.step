In C++, however, there is a very good chance that your runtime error will simply say <span class=\"wysiwyg-font-tt\">SEGMENTATION FAULT</span>. Many Java programmers who transition to C++ are frustrated with the lack of detail in C++ runtime errors in comparison to Java runtime errors, so if you fall into this boat, do not feel discouraged!
