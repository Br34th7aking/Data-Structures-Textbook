The safety checks built into Java slow down the execution of your code, but the lack of these safety checks in C++ means that, even if your code's logic is incorrect, you may still be allowed to execute it which can make debugging tricky.</p><p><b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">STOP and Think:</span></b> Based on the descriptions above, why would we use C++ instead of Java to implement data structures in this course?</p>", "tests_archive": null, "source": null, "subtitle_files": [], "options": {}, "feedback_correct": "", "video": null}, "id": "95883", "time": "2016-09-06T23:40:32.021598"}
