An\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">array</span></b> is a homogeneous data structure: all elements are of the same type (int, string, etc). Also, the elements of an <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">array</span></b> are stored in adjacent memory locations.\n\nBelow is an example of an <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">array</span></b>, where the number inside each cell is the index of that cell, using 0-based indexing (i.e., the first element is at index 0, the second element is at index 1, etc.).</p><p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/5b887fc5-9533-4a0c-9765-badb4c1be849/\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Because each cell has the same type (and thus the same size), and because the cells are adjacent in memory, it is possible to quickly calculate the address of any array cell, given the address of the first cell.</p><p>Say we allocate memory for an <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">array</span></b> of\u00a0<i>n</i> elements (the total number of cells of the array must be defined beforehand), where the elements of the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">array</span></b> are of a type that has a size of\u00a0<i>b</i> bytes (e.g. a C++ <span class=\"wysiwyg-font-tt\">int</span> has a size of 4 bytes), and the resulting <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">array</span></b> is allocated starting at memory address\u00a0<i>x</i>. Using 0-based indexing, the element at index\u00a0<i>i</i> = 0 is at memory address\u00a0<i>x</i>, the element at index\u00a0<i>i</i> = 1 is at memory address\u00a0<i>x</i> +\u00a0<i>b</i>, and the element at index\u00a0<i>i</i> is at memory address\u00a0<i>x</i> +\u00a0<i>bi</i>.
