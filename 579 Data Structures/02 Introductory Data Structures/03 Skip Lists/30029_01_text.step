We saw that we could obtain worst-case O(log\u00a0<i>n</i>) find operations with an\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">Array List</span></b> if we kept it sorted and used <i>binary search</i>, but insert and remove operations would always be O(<i>n</i>). Also, to avoid having to keep rebuilding the backing array, we had to allocate extra space, which was was wasteful. We also saw that, with a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Linked List</span></b>, we could obtain worst-case O(1) insert and remove operations to the front or back of the structure, but finding elements would be O(<i>n</i>), even if we were to keep the elements sorted. This is because\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Linked Lists</span></b> lack the <i>random access</i> property that\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">Array Lists</span></b> have. Also, because each node in a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Linked List</span></b> is created on-the-fly, we don't have to waste extra space like we did with the\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">Array List</span></b>.</p><p>Is there any way for us to somehow reap the benefits of both data structures? In 1989, computer scientist William Pugh invented\u00a0the\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Skip List</span></b>, a data structure that expands on the\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Linked List</span></b> and uses extra forward pointers with some random number generation to simulate the binary search algorithm achievable in\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">Array Lists</span></b>.</p><p><img title=\"Image: https://ucarecdn.com/1cab37ee-a002-4a31-abe3-b9f2f2dd556f/\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/1cab37ee-a002-4a31-abe3-b9f2f2dd556f/\"></p><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><b>Figure:</b>\ufeff William Pugh (from <a href=\"https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/pugh/bio.html\">his website</a>)<br></p>", "subtitles": {}, "tests_archive": null}, "time": "2016-09-15T14:58:27.452810"}
