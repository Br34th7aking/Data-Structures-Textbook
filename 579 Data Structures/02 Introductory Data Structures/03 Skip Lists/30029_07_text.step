To emphasize this thought, look at the following\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Skip List</span></b>, and notice how using it is no faster than using an ordinary\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Linked List</span></b>\u00a0because we have to potentially iterate over all\u00a0<i>n</i> elements in the worst case:</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/db5e6407-7dfd-4cbf-9820-456a1c913c30/\"></p><p>However, this next example of a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Skip List</span></b> has a better distribution of heights, meaning we check less elements to find the one we want:</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/28eab8f8-c850-477c-a8e1-4fa7ee7cddee/\" title=\"Image: https://ucarecdn.com/28eab8f8-c850-477c-a8e1-4fa7ee7cddee/\"></p><p>Clearly, the distribution of heights has a significant impact on the performance of a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Skip List</span></b>.
