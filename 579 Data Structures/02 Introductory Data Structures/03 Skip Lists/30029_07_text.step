To emphasize this thought, look at the following\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Skip List</span></b>, and notice how using it is no faster than using an ordinary\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Linked List</span></b>\u00a0because we have to potentially iterate over all\u00a0<i>n</i> elements in the worst case:</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/db5e6407-7dfd-4cbf-9820-456a1c913c30/\"></p><p>For example, finding node 5 would require 5 node traversals and finding node 3 would require 3 node traversals. <br></p><p>However, this next example of a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Skip List</span></b> has a better distribution of heights, meaning we check less elements to find the one we want:</p><p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/28eab8f8-c850-477c-a8e1-4fa7ee7cddee/\" alt=\"\" title=\"Image: https://ucarecdn.com/28eab8f8-c850-477c-a8e1-4fa7ee7cddee/\"></p><p>For example, finding node 5 would require 1 node traversal and finding node 3 would require 2 node traversals. <br></p><p>Clearly, the distribution of heights has a significant impact on the performance of a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Skip List</span></b>. With the best distribution of heights, the\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Skip List</span></b> \"find\" algorithm effectively performs binary search, resulting in a O(log\u00a0<i>n</i>) time complexity. Thus, we must ask ourselves the following question: How can we design our\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Skip List</span></b> such that heights are automatically \"well-distributed\"?</p>", "subtitle_files": [], "subtitles": {}, "feedback_wrong": "", "name": "text", "source": null, "options": {}}, "id": "121923", "time": "2016-09-14T00:08:20.434908"}
