A coin-flip is a <b>Bernoulli distribution</b>\u00a0(or a <b>binary distribution</b>), which is just the formal name for a probability distribution in which we only have two possible outcomes: <i>success</i>\u00a0and <i>failure</i>\u00a0(which we often call <i>heads</i>\u00a0and <i>tails</i>, <i>yes</i>\u00a0and <i>no</i>, etc.). We say that <i>p</i>\u00a0is the probability of <i>success</i>, and we say that <i>q</i>, which equals 1\u2013<i>p</i>, is the probability of <i>failure</i>.</p><p>What we described above, where we perform multiple coin-flips until we get our first tails, is synonymous to saying \"Sample from a Bernoulli distribution until you see the first failure.\" It turns out that this statement is actually a probability distribution in itself: the <b>Geometric distribution</b>. The Geometric distribution tells us, given a Bernoulli distribution with probability <i>p</i>\u00a0of <i>success</i>, what is the probability that our <i>k</i>-th trial (i.e., our <i>k</i>-th coin-flip) results in the<i> last failure in a row before </i>the<i></i>\u00a0<i>first success</i>? Formally, for a Geometric random variable <i>X</i>, we say that $\\Pr(X=k)=(1\u2212p)^{k}p $: we need <i>k</i>\u00a0<i>failures</i>\u00a0(each with probability 1\u2013<i>p</i>), and then we need one <i>success</i>\u00a0(with probability <i>p</i>).</p><p>But wait! The Geometric distribution tells us about the number of flips until the first <i>success</i>, but we want the number of flips until the first <i>failure</i>! It turns out that we can trivially modify what we just said to make the general definition of a Geometric distribution work for us. Recall that <i>success</i>\u00a0and <i>failure</i>\u00a0are just two events, where the probability of <i>success</i>\u00a0is <i>p</i>\u00a0and the probability of <i>failure</i>\u00a0is <i>q</i>\u00a0= 1\u2013<i>p</i>. If we simply swap them when we plug them into the Geometric distribution, we will have swapped <i>success</i>\u00a0and <i>failure</i>, so the expected value of the Geometric distribution would tell us the expected number of trials until the first <i>failure</i>. Formally, $ \\Pr(X=k)=p^{k}(1\u2212p) $: we need <i>k</i>\u00a0<i>successes</i>\u00a0(each with probability <i>p</i>), and then we need one <i>failure</i>\u00a0(with probability 1\u2013<i>p</i>).</p><p>Therefore, if we were to sample from a Geometric distribution following\u00a0$ \\Pr(X=k)=p^{k}(1-p) $, we would get a random value for\u00a0<i>k</i>, the number of coin-flips it\u00a0<i>before</i> the first\u00a0<i>failure</i>, which is exactly our new node's height!</p><p>If this probability and statistics detour didn't make much sense to you, that's perfectly fine. Performing separate individual coin-flips, each with probability\u00a0<i>p</i>\ufeff of success, vs. performing a single trial from the Geometric distribution above are both completely mathematically equivalent. It's just an interesting connection we wanted to make for those of you who were interested.</p><p></p>", "feedback_correct": "", "tests_archive": null, "subtitle_files": [], "name": "text"}, "time": "2016-09-03T01:06:52.191594"}
