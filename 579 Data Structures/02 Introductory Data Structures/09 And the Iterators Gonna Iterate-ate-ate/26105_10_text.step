Then, we learned about some specifics regarding implementation of the data structures themselves. Now, we have learned about a key feature that we can implement into our data structures: iterators, these powerful entities that allow the user to iterate over the elements of\u00a0<i>any</i> data structure in a clean and uniform syntax, without knowing how the data structure actually works on the inside.</p><p>Of course, as you noticed in the last portions of this section, iterators can be a\u00a0<i>pain</i> to implement from scratch! Lucky for us, in practically all programming languages, some pretty smart people have already gone through and implemented all of the fundamental data structures, and for each data structure implementation, they have implemented iterators for us. In practice, you will always want to use some existing implementation of a data structure (and its iterator implementation): in C++, you would want to use data structures already implemented in the STL, which are implemented extremely efficiently.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is important to know\u00a0<i>how</i> to go about implementing things from scratch, as you never know what you will see in life! Perhaps you will enter an extremely niche field of research, and data structures you need have not yet been implemented in the language of your preference, or perhaps you are secretly a genius who will one day design a groundbreaking super efficient data structure all on your own, for which you will of course give credit to the authors of the amazing online textbook that sparked your interest in data structures in the first place. Either way, you may one day finding yourself needing to know the good practices of data structure implementation, and the iterator pattern is a key feature you will want to implement.</p>", "subtitle_files": [], "source": null, "animation": null, "video": null, "tests_archive": null, "options": {}, "subtitles": {}}, "time": "2016-09-05T17:07:18.009886"}
