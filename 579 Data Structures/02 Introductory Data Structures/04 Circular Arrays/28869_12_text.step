{"block": {"animation": null, "source": null, "text": "<p>So far, we've only looked at adding or removing elements from the front or back of a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Circular Array</span></b>, which is no better than adding or removing elements from the front or back of a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Linked List</span></b>. So what was the point of all this added complexity? Recall that, with a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Linked List</span></b>, if we want to access an element somewhere in the middle of the list, even if we know which index of our list we want to access, we need to perform an O(<i>n</i>) iteration to follow pointers and reach our destination. However, with a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Circular Array</span></b>, the backing structure is an <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">Array List</span></b>, meaning we have random access to any element given that we know which index of the backing array we need to query.</p><p>If we want to access the element of a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Circular Array</span></b> at index\u00a0<i>i</i>, where\u00a0<i>i</i> is with respect to the <i>head</i>\u00a0index (i.e., <i>head</i>\u00a0is\u00a0<i>i</i> = 0, irrespective of what index it is in the backing array), we can simply access the element at index <b>(</b><i><b>head</b></i><b> +\u00a0</b><i><b>i</b></i><b>) %\u00a0</b><i><b>array.length</b></i> in the backing array. By modding by the backing array's length, we ensure that the index we get from the operation (<i>head</i> +\u00a0<i>i</i>) wraps around to a valid index if it exceeds the boundaries of the array.</p><p>Below is an example of a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Circular Array</span></b> where the\u00a0<i>head</i> index wrapped around. Notice that, if we consider\u00a0<i>head</i> to be \"<i>i</i> = 0\" of our elements (even though it's index 7 of the backing array), we can access any\u00a0<i>i</i>-th element of our list via the formula above. For example, the element at\u00a0<i>i</i> = 2 of our list is at index (7 + 2) % 8 = 9 % 8 = 1 of the backing array, which corresponds to c.</p><p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/ff66b7b0-a3d0-4994-b57a-9b83fddc511c/\" alt=\"\" title=\"Image: https://ucarecdn.com/ff66b7b0-a3d0-4994-b57a-9b83fddc511c/\"></p><p>\n\n<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">STOP and Think:</span></b> Under what condition(s) would we be safe to omit the mod operation in the formula above?
