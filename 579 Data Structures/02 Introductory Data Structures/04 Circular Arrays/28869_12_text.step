Recall that, with a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Linked List</span></b>, if I want to access an element somewhere in the middle of the list, even if I know which index of my list I want to access, I need to perform a O(<i>n</i>) iteration to follow pointers and reach my destination. However, with a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Circular Array</span></b>, the backing structure is an <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">Array List</span></b>, meaning we have random access to any element given that we know which index of the backing array we need to query.</p><p>If we want to access the element of a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Circular Array</span></b> at index\u00a0<i>i</i>, where\u00a0<i>i</i> is with respect to the <i>head</i>\u00a0index (i.e., <i>head</i>\u00a0is\u00a0<i>i</i> = 0, irrespective of what index it is in the backing array), I can simply access the element at index <b>(</b><i><b>head</b></i><b> +\u00a0</b><i><b>i</b></i><b>) %\u00a0</b><i><b>array.length</b></i> in the backing array. By modding by the backing array's length, I ensure that the index I get from the operation (<i>head</i> +\u00a0<i>i</i>) wraps around to a valid index if it exceeds the boundaries of the array.</p><p>Below is an example of a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Circular Array</span></b> where the\u00a0<i>head</i> index wrapped around. Notice that, if we consider\u00a0<i>head</i> to be \"<i>i</i> = 0\" of our elements (even though it's index 7 of the backing array), we can access any\u00a0<i>i</i>-th element of our list via the formula above. For example, the element at\u00a0<i>i</i> = 2 of our list is at index (7 + 2) % 8 = 9 % 8 = 1 of the backing array, which corresponds to c.</p><p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/ff66b7b0-a3d0-4994-b57a-9b83fddc511c/\" alt=\"\"></p><p>\n\n<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">STOP and Think:</span></b> Under what condition(s) would we be safe to omit the mod operation in the formula above?
