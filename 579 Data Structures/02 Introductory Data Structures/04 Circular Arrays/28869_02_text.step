Recall that a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Linked List</span></b> has a <i>head</i> pointer and a <i>tail</i> pointer, and when we want to insert an element to the beginning or end of a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Linked List</span></b>, all we do is update a few pointers, which is a constant-time operation.</p><p>What if, similar to <i>head</i> and <i>tail</i> pointers in a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Linked List</span></b>, we take our <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">Array List</span></b>\u00a0and use <i>head</i>\u00a0and <i>tail</i>\u00a0indices?\u00a0The first element would be the element at the <i>head</i>\u00a0index, and the last element would be the element at the <i>tail</i>\u00a0index.\n\nAs we add to the tail of the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Circular Array</span></b>, we can simply increment <i>tail</i>, and likewise, as we add to the head of the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Circular Array</span></b>, we can simply decrement <i>head</i>. As we increment\u00a0<i>tail</i>, if we ever go out of bounds (i.e., <i>tail</i>\u00a0becomes equal to the size of the array), we can simply wrap around to index 0. Likewise, as we're decrementing <i>head</i>, if we ever go out of bounds (i.e., <i>head</i>\u00a0becomes -1), we can simply wrap around to the last index of the array (i.e., <i>size</i>\u20131).</p>", "feedback_correct": "", "tests_archive": null, "subtitles": {}, "source": null, "name": "text", "video": null, "feedback_wrong": "", "options": {}, "animation": null}}
