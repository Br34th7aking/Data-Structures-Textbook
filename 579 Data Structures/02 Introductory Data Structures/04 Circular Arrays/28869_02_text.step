{"block": {"animation": null, "source": null, "text": "<p>At the lowest level, a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Circular Array</span></b> is really just a regular <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">Array List</span></b> with a clever implementation: we will try to mimic the implementation of a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Linked List</span></b>. Recall that a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Linked List</span></b> has a <i>head</i> pointer and a <i>tail</i> pointer, and when we want to insert an element to the beginning or end of a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Linked List</span></b>, all we do is update a few pointers (which is a constant-time operation).</p><p>What if, similar to <i>head</i> and <i>tail</i> pointers in a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Linked List</span></b>, we take our <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">Array List</span></b>\u00a0and use <i>head</i>\u00a0and <i>tail</i>\u00a0indices?\u00a0The first element would be the element at the <i>head</i>\u00a0index, and the last element would be the element at the <i>tail</i>\u00a0index.\n\nAs we add to the tail of the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Circular Array</span></b>, we can simply increment <i>tail</i>, and likewise, as we add to the head of the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Circular Array</span></b>, we can simply decrement <i>head</i>. As we increment\u00a0<i>tail</i>, if we ever go out of bounds (i.e., <i>tail</i>\u00a0becomes equal to the size of the array), we can simply wrap around to index 0. Likewise, as we're decrementing <i>head</i>, if we ever go out of bounds (i.e., <i>head</i>\u00a0becomes -1), we can simply wrap around to the last index of the array (i.e., <i>size</i>\u20131).</p><p>Note that, just like with an\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">Array List</span></b>, the elements of our\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Circular Array</span></b>\u00a0will be contiguous in the backing array. The reason for this is that we will only allow users to insert to the <i>head</i> or the <i>tail</i>\u00a0of the\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Circular Array</span></b>.</p>", "feedback_correct": "", "feedback_wrong": "", "video": null, "name": "text", "subtitles": {}, "subtitle_files": [], "options": {}, "tests_archive": null}, "id": "114890", "time": "2016-09-20T01:08:08.793638"}
