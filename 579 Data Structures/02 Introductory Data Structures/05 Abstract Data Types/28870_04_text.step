When we listen to music, do we always necessarily want to iterate through the songs in the order in which they appear? Typically, we like having the ability to choose a specific song, which could appear somewhere in the middle of the list of songs. As a result, it might make sense for us, the programmers, to use an array-based structure to implement this <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">ADT</span></b> because having random access could prove useful. However, we very well could use a Linked List to implement this <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">ADT</span></b>  instead! The functionality would still be correct, but it might not be as fast as using an array-based structure.</p><p>In the next sections, we will discuss some fundamental <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">Abstract Data Types</span></b> and will discuss different approaches we can use to implement them (as well as the trade-offs of each approach).</p>", "subtitle_files": [], "subtitles": {}, "feedback_wrong": "", "name": "text", "source": null, "options": {}}, "id": "111094", "time": "2016-09-14T00:08:41.621459"}
