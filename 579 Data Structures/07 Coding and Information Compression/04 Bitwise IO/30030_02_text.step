However, note that accessing the disk is an\u00a0<i>extremely</i> slow operation. We won't go into the computer architecture details that explain\u00a0<i>why</i> this is the case, but take our word for now that it is. As a result, instead of writing every single byte to disk one at a time (which would be very slow), computers (actually, programming languages) have a \"write buffer\": we designate numerous bytes to be written, but instead of being written to disk immediately, they are stored in a buffer in memory (which is fast), and once the buffer is full, the\u00a0<i>entire buffer</i> is written to disk at once. Likewise, for\u00a0<i>reading</i> from disk, the same logic holds: reading individual bytes is extremely slow, so instead, we have a \"read buffer\" in memory to which we read\u00a0<i>multiple</i> bytes from disk, and we pull individual bytes from this buffer.\u00a0Typically, a default value for a disk buffer is 4 kilobytes (i.e., 4,096 bytes).</p><p>The basic workflow for writing <i>bytes</i> to disk is as follows:</p><p></p><ul><li>Write bytes to buffer, one byte at a time</li><li>Once the buffer is full, write the entire buffer to disk and clear the buffer (i.e., \"flush\" the buffer)</li><li>Repeat</li></ul><p></p><p>In most languages, one can create an \"output stream\" that handles filling the buffer, writing to disk, etc. for us on its own.
