Even with Huffman Compression, clever techniques exist to further improve its compression abilities. For example, biologically, different segments of an organism's genome may have different symbol frequencies. Say, for example, that the first half of a genome is enriched in C's and G's, whereas the second half of the genome is enriched in A's and T's. If we were to split the genome into two pieces, Huffman Compress each piece independently of the other, and then merge these two encoded messages (including some indicator in the merged encoded message that tells us when one segment has finished and the other has started), we will be able to attain even better compression than if we were to Huffman Compress the entire genome in one go.</p><p>Also, note that Huffman Compression is a <b>lossless</b> compression algorithm, meaning we can compress a file, and when we decompress the resulting file, it will be completely identical to the original. However, we would be able to achieve better compression if we removed this lossless requirement. Such algorithms, in which the original file can\u00a0<i>not</i> be extracted from the compressed file, are called <b>lossy</b> compression algorithms. For example, when it comes to music, the lossless source file of a typical song 4 minutes in length will be approximately 25 MB. However, if we were to perform lossy compression on the file by encoding it using the MP3 audio compression algorithm, we can compress the file to somewhere in the range of 1 to 5 MB depending on what bitrate at which we choose to compress the file.</p><p>We live in an age of data, so file compression is vital to practically every part of our daily life. With better file compression, we could:</p><p></p><ul><li>Store more songs and movies on our mobile devices</li><li>Speed up our internet browsing</li><li>Archive important files in a feasible fashion</li><li>Do infinitely more cool things!</li></ul><p></p>", "options": {}, "feedback_correct": "", "source": null, "subtitle_files": [], "name": "text", "feedback_wrong": "", "subtitles": {}, "tests_archive": null, "video": null}}
