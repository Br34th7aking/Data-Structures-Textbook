In this tree, edges are labeled by \"code\" symbols, and the \"non-coded\" symbols label the leaves. A non-coded symbol (i.e., a leaf in the coding tree) is encoded by the \"code\" symbols labeling the edges in the path from the root to the non-coded symbol. For example, take the following simple coding tree:</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/7408320b-48d7-4dac-b8a8-5bfd83c338b1/\"></p><p>In this tree, <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">A</span></b> is encoded by <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">00</span></b>, <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">C</span></b> is encoded by <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">01</span></b>, <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">G</span></b> is encoded by <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">10</span></b>, and <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">T</span></b> is encoded by <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">11</span></b>.</p>", "source": null, "subtitles": {}, "feedback_correct": ""}, "time": "2016-09-12T22:33:13.998484"}
