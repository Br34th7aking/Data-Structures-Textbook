However, so far we've only been given the opportunity to store only one object at a time (the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">key</span></b>). For example, if we had a class of students, we could either store all their names or all their grades<span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\"><b></b>, but not both</span></span>, within a single <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Table</span></b>.
