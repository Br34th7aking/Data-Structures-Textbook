As a result, we would need to make sure that delete would delete <i>all</i> copies of the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">key</span></b> <i>k</i>. <br>Note that if we wanted to have an optimized \"delete\" as opposed to \"insert\" method, then we would chose to check for duplicate insertions in the \"insert\" method. <br></p>", "options": {}, "subtitle_files": [], "name": "text", "video": null, "feedback_wrong": ""}, "id": "121807"}
