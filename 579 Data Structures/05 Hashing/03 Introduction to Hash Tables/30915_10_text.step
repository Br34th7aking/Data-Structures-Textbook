However, this is arguably the most important part of implementing an optimized <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Table. </span></b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">Why?</span> Because more often than not, a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">hash function</span></b>\n is mapping from a large set (e.g. the numbers 1 to 1,000,000 for a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Table</span></b> storing income, strings in the form of all possible names \nfor a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Table</span></b> storing employee information, etc.) to a much smaller set: \nthe set of <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Table</span></b> locations. Since computers do not have unlimited memory, the set of <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Table</span></b> locations is in fact <i>much much</i> smaller than the large set of information.  As a result, we suffer an extremely high probability of <i>collisions</i>: two different keys wanting to be at the same <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Table</span></b> location. <br><br>Within the lesson, we had pseudocoded that if a collision were to happen, we would just not insert the  <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">key</span></b>. In practice however, that would be a terrible data structure if we couldn't insert all the values we wanted. As a result, we need to invest time into thinking about the best possible ways to\u00a0<i>avoid</i> collisions in the first place and what to do if a collision were to happen. In the next lesson we will use probability theory to discuss collisions in more depth and also find out how to design the best possible <b>size</b>\u00a0for a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Table</span></b>\u00a0to help us <i>avoid</i>\u00a0collisions. \n\n", "feedback_correct": "", "video": null, "animation": null}}
