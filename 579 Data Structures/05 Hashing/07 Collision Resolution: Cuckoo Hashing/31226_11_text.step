It provides us a guaranteed worst-case constant time\n complexity in operations (find and delete) that previous strategies \nwere unable to guarantee. Because of the complexity of <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Cuckoo Hashing</span></b> however, there are many more analysis and proofs that this lesson has left out.
