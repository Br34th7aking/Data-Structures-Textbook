{"block": {"tests_archive": null, "feedback_correct": "", "subtitle_files": [], "text": "<p>The final <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">collision resolution strategy</span></b> that we will discuss is called <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Cuckoo Hashing</span></b>. <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Cuckoo Hashing</span></b> --- and it weird name --- comes from the concept of actual Cuckoo chicks pushing each other out of their nests in order to have more space to live. In all the previous open addressing <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">collision resolution strategies</span></b> we have discussed so far, if an inserting key collided with a key already in the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">hash table</span></b>, the inserting key would take responsibility to find a new place. In <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Cuckoo Hashing</span></b>, however, an arguably more aggressive and opposite approach takes place: if an inserting key collides with a key already in the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">hash table</span></b>, the inserting key pushes out the key in its way and takes its place. The displaced key then hashes to a new location (ouch...).<br></p><p>More formally, <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Cuckoo Hashing</span></b> is defined as having two hashing functions,\u00a0$ H_1(k) $  and\u00a0$ H_2(k) $, both of which return a position in the\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">hash table</span></b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">. As a result, one key has strictly two different hashing locations, where $ H_1(k)$ is the first location that a key always maps to (but doesn't necessarily always stay at). A simplified version (we will see in the next step that the algorithm traditionally uses two <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">hash tables</span></b>) of <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Cuckoo Hashing</span></b> can be seen in the animation below.
