As a result, one key has strictly two different hashing locations, where $ H_1(k)$ is the first location that a key always maps to (but doesn't necessarily always stay at). A simplified version (we will see in the next step that the algorithm traditionally uses two <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">hash tables</span></b>) of <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Cuckoo Hashing</span></b> can be seen in the animation below.
