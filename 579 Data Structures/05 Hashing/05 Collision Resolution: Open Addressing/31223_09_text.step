The answer is if we were to do so, our find method would always end up taking O(N) time to find an element; this is very inefficient. Statistically the find method is called much more often than the delete method and as a result, it makes more sense to keep the find method as optimized as possible.<br></p><p>Consequently, the solution to this conundrum is to use a \"deleted\" flag. In other words, we need to specify to the hash table that though there is in fact no element in that slot anymore, we still need to look beyond it since the slot has been <i>deleted</i> from. <br></p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/a2ab89c8-8ac8-4b87-8c72-78f7cfe780bd/\" width=\"505\" height=\"402\"></p><p>Now that we have discovered a proper delete method, it is important to note that we face the problem of these \"deleted\" flags piling up and our find method becoming more and more inefficient.
