By using a deterministic second <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">hash function</span></b> that depends upon the key being inserted, we are able to get a more uniform distribution of the keys while still having the ability to figure out where we expect to find the key.

However, the remove algorithm for <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Double Hashing</span></b> and for <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Random Hashing</span></b> still turn out to be as wasteful as for <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Linear Probing</span></b>, so we still have to worry about reinserting elements into the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Hash Table</span></b> periodically to clean up the \"delete\" flags.
