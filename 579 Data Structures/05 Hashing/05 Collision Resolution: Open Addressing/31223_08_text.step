This would work, but if we were to do so, our find operations would become <i>significantly</i> less\u00a0efficient. In practice, the find operation is used much more frequently than the remove operation, and as a result, it makes more sense to keep the find operation as optimized as possible.<br></p><p>Consequently, the solution to this conundrum is to use a \"deleted\" flag.
