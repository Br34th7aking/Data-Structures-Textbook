Moreover, we have the requirement that <i>all</i> the leaves are <i>always</i> on the <b>same</b> level; so how do we achieve this? The secret to achieve having the leaves constantly be on the same level is to have the tree grow <i>upward </i>instead of down from the root, as it has in all the previous tree structures we have discussed so far. <br></span></span></p><p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">Let's look at an example for a   <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">B-tree</span></b> where <i>b=2</i>:</span></span></p><p><br><img width=\"429\" alt=\"\" height=\"216\" title=\"Image: https://ucarecdn.com/94ab1756-32cc-432b-aea3-a3e29fe3904a/\" src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/94ab1756-32cc-432b-aea3-a3e29fe3904a/\"></p><img width=\"424\" alt=\"\" height=\"280\" title=\"Image: https://ucarecdn.com/adea16b1-298e-4606-a548-b0cacd5f981e/\" src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/adea16b1-298e-4606-a548-b0cacd5f981e/\"><br>Notice how every time we insert, we \"shuffle\" over the keys to make sure that the keys in our node stay properly sorted.<br>Also, notice that in the first 3 insertions there was just one node and that node was the root. However, in the last insertion where our node grew too big, we created a new node <i>on top</i> (i.e., the tree grew <i>upward</i>) and re-defined the new node---with key 4--- to be the root. By doing so, we have now kept all the leaves at the same level! <br>", "feedback_correct": "", "tests_archive": null, "subtitles": {}, "source": null, "name": "text", "video": null, "feedback_wrong": "", "options": {}, "animation": null}}
