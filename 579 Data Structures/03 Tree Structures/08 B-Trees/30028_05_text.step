The insert operation for a  <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">B-Tree </span></b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">is a slightly intricate matter since, as we mentioned earlier, this <i>is</i> a self-balancing tree. Moreover, we have the requirement that <i>all</i> the leaves are <i>always</i> on the <b>same</b> level; so how do we achieve this? The secret to achieve having the leaves constantly be on the same level is to have the tree grow <i>upward </i>instead of down from the root, as it has in all the previous tree structures we have discussed so far. <br></span></span></p><p><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">Let's look at an example for a   <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">B-Tree</span></b> where <i>b=2</i>:</span></span></p><p><br><img height=\"216\" width=\"429\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/94ab1756-32cc-432b-aea3-a3e29fe3904a/\"></p><img height=\"280\" width=\"424\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/adea16b1-298e-4606-a548-b0cacd5f981e/\"><br>Notice how every time we insert, we \"shuffle\" over the keys to make sure that the keys in our node stay properly sorted.<br>Also, notice that in the first 3 insertions there was just one node and that node was the root. However, in the last insertion where our node grew too big, we cut the node and chose the largest key of the first half of the node to create a new root (i.e., the tree grew <i>upward</i>). By doing so, we have now kept all the leaves at the same level! <br><p></p>", "feedback_wrong": "", "options": {}, "subtitles": {}, "name": "text", "source": null, "video": null, "animation": null}, "time": "2016-09-11T01:08:34.034858", "id": "122791"}
