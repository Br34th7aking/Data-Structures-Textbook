Since it is known that the Hard Disk is designed in block like structures (to help the CPU traverse memory more efficiently) a single node in a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">B-Tree</span></b> is therefore specifically designed to fit in one \"Hard Disk block\" to ensure that the CPU copies over <i>all </i>the data from a single node in one access. <br></p><p>Moreover, since  <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">B-Trees</span></b> have such a good system in place to efficiently read stored data from the Hard Disk, it is very common for   <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">B-Trees</span></b> to explicitly store its data directly on the Hard Disk so we can save the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">B-Tree</span></b> to access later without having to re-build it from scratch. Note that if we do this, then the worst case number of Hard Disk reads that we will need to make is equal to the height of the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">B-Tree</span></b>!<br></p><p>Databases and file systems are common for storing large amounts of relational data on the Hard Disk.
