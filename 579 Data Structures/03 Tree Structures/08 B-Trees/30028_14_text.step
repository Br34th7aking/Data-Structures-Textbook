Because it is known that the Hard Disk is designed in block-like structures (to help the CPU traverse memory more efficiently), a single node in a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">B-Tree</span></b> is specifically designed to fit in one \"Hard Disk block\" to ensure that the CPU copies over <i>all</i> the data from a single node in one access.</p><p>Moreover, since  <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">B-Trees</span></b> have such a good system in place for efficiently reading stored data from the Hard Disk, it is very common for <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">B-Trees</span></b> to explicitly store their data directly on the Hard Disk so we can save the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">B-Tree</span></b> and have the ability to access it later without having to re-build it from scratch.
