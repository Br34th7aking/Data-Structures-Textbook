The major difference is that, because data records are <i>only</i> stored in the leaves, we will always be deleting from the leaves. However, problems start to arise when we need to deal with an existing key in the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">B+ Tree</span></b> that all of a sudden may or may not have its respective data record in the tree (depending on whether or not it was deleted). Consequently, a lot of merging of leaf nodes and key redistributions begin to happen. Therefore, we will omit formal discussion of the deletion algorithm for a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">B+ Tree</span></b> in this text. Nonetheless, we recommend playing with the visualization below, created by <a href=\"https://www.cs.usfca.edu/%7Egalles/\" title=\"Link: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/%7Egalles/\" rel=\"nofollow\">David Galles</a>\r\n at the University of San Francisco, in order to see how deleting different data records can result in different techniques to handle rebalancing the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">B+ Tree</span></b>.</p><p>It is important to note, however, that the worst-case time complexity of the delete operation for a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">B+ Tree</span></b> turns out to be the same as the insert operation, $ O(M\\log_{M}{n} + L )$. Why? In the worst case, we need to traverse over all <i>M</i> keys in an internal node, all <i>L</i> data records in a leaf node, and all $ O(\\log_{M}{n}) $ levels of the tree, similarly to insert.</p><p><b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Note:</span></b> The \"Max Degree\" (maximum number of children) option is equal to<i> </i><i>M</i>.</p><p><iframe src=\"https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BPlusTree.html\" width=\"100%\" height=\"810px\" scrolling=\"yes\"></iframe></p>", "options": {}}, "id": "124457"}
