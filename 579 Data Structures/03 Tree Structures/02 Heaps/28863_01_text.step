Clearly there is some logic regarding the order in which we see patients, but does an emergency room line follow a queue?</p><p>Say we have an emergency room line containing 10 individuals, all with pretty minor injuries (e.g. cuts/bruises). Clearly, the order in which these 10 patients are treated doesn't really matter, so perhaps the doctor can see them in the order in which they arrived. Suddenly, someone rushes through the door with a bullet wound that needs to be treated immediately. Should this individual wait until all 10 minor-injury patients are treated before he can be seen?</p><p>Clearly, we need an ADT that is similar to a <b>Queue</b>, but which can order elements based on some\u00a0<i>priority</i> as opposed to blindly following the \"First In First Out\" (FIFO) ordering.
