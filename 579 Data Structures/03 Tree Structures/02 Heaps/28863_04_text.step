The concept of <i>priority</i>\u00a0can be more easily understood by looking at the two types of <b>heaps</b>: the <b>min-heap</b>\u00a0and the <b>max-heap</b>.</p><p>A <b>min-heap</b>\u00a0is a heap where every node is <i><b>smaller</b></i>\u00a0than (or equal to) all of its children (or has no children). In other words, a node <i>A</i>\u00a0is said to have\u00a0<i>higher priority</i>\u00a0than a node <i>B</i>\u00a0if <i>A</i>\u00a0&lt; <i>B</i>\u00a0(i.e., when comparing two nodes, the <i>smaller</i> of the two has higher priority). Below is an example of a <b>min-heap</b> (which happens to be the same example as the previous step):</p><p><img alt=\"\" title=\"Image: https://ucarecdn.com/d7c64a9b-8226-4b6d-bfdd-028798c35bfd/\" src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/d7c64a9b-8226-4b6d-bfdd-028798c35bfd/\"></p><p>A\u00a0<b>max-heap</b> is a heap where every node is\u00a0<b><i>larger</i></b><i></i> than (or equal to) all of its children (or has no children).
