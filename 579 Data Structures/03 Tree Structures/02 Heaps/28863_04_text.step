{"block": {"animation": null, "source": null, "text": "<p>We mentioned the term \"priority\", but what does it formally mean in the context of elements in a tree? The concept of <i>priority</i>\u00a0can be more easily understood by looking at the two types of <b>heaps</b>: the <b>min-heap</b>\u00a0and the <b>max-heap</b>.</p><p>A <b>min-heap</b>\u00a0is a heap where every node is <i><b>smaller</b></i>\u00a0than (or equal to) all of its children (or has no children). In other words, a node <i>A</i>\u00a0is said to have\u00a0<i>higher priority</i>\u00a0than a node <i>B</i>\u00a0if <i>A</i>\u00a0&lt; <i>B</i>\u00a0(i.e., when comparing two nodes, the <i>smaller</i> of the two has higher priority). Below is an example of a <b>min-heap</b> (which happens to be the same example as the previous step):</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/d7c64a9b-8226-4b6d-bfdd-028798c35bfd/\"></p><p>A\u00a0<b>max-heap</b> is a heap where every node is\u00a0<b><i>larger</i></b><i></i> than (or equal to) all of its children (or has no children).

Going back to the initial hospital example that motivated this discussion in the first place, what if we had\u00a0<i>two</i> victims with bullet wounds, both of whom entered the hospital at the same time? The choice of which patient to see first is arbitrary: both patients have equally high priorities. As a result, in a\u00a0<b>heap</b>, if you encounter duplicate priorities, simply break ties arbitrarily.</p>", "feedback_correct": "", "feedback_wrong": "", "video": null, "name": "text", "subtitles": {}, "subtitle_files": [], "options": {}, "tests_archive": null}, "id": "117045", "time": "2016-09-20T01:09:19.516785"}
