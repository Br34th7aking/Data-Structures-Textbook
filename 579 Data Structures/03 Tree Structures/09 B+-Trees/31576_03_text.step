Note that the nodes outlined in black are filled with <i>keys</i> (i.e., the integers we use to sort the tree) and the nodes outlined in purple are the leaves filled with <i>all</i> the data records. Consequently, you will notice that some integers are repeated twice within the <b> <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">B+-Tree</span></b> (e.g. there are two instances of the key 7). <br><br>Also note that we are using integer values to sort the tree <i>and</i> we are storing the integer values themselves. As a result, the\u00a0<i>keys</i> are equal to the\u00a0<i>data records</i>\ufeff. However, if we were inserting large database entries, then the data records in the purple boxes would contain more information other than just an integer value.\u00a0 <br><br><img height=\"272\" src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/ac69d99f-0a46-4063-8b3b-677b836cf58b/\" width=\"504\" alt=\"\" title=\"Image: https://ucarecdn.com/ac69d99f-0a46-4063-8b3b-677b836cf58b/\"><br><b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">STOP and Think: </span></b>Can you see how the purple data records are sorted in a <b> <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">B+-Tree</span></b>? <br><br><p><b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Note:</span></b> Hopefully you have noticed that the<b> <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">B+-Tree</span></b> that we introduced <i>technically </i>violates one of the fundamental properties of a <b>tree</b>: the green linked list arrows cause undirected cycles to appear in the <b>tree</b>. As a result, this presents a bit of a conundrum because on the one hand, the<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\"> B+-Tree</span></b> that is used <i>in practice</i> to <i>actually</i> implement databases really does use the linked list structure at the bottom. On the other hand, <i>in theory</i>, this is no longer a <b>tree</b> and is actually by definition a <b>graph</b>. So what are we going to do about this? Well, since we have agreed to stick to talking about <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">B+-</span><i><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">Trees,</span> </i></b>for this lesson and for the purpose of this course, we are going to omit the linked list structure at the leaves in order to keep a <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\"><b>B+-</b></span><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\"><b>Tree</b></span> a valid <b>tree</b>. Do keep in mind however that, in practice, it is common for people to still refer to using a \"<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">B+-Tree</span></b>\" structure to implement their database <i>with</i> the use of the linked list leaf structure. <br></p>", "subtitles": {}, "tests_archive": null}, "time": "2016-09-15T15:01:32.490221"}
