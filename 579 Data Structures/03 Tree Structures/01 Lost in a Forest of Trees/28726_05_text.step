In some contexts, we might want to interpret this hierarchy as \"top-down\" (i.e., we care about relationships from root to leaves) or as \"bottom-up\" (i.e., we care about relationships from leaves to root), but either way, the underlying tree structure is the same, despite how we choose to interpret the hierarchy it can represent.</p><p>For example, in Bioinformatics, we can study a paternal lineage of humans by creating an evolutionary tree from the Y chromosomes of a large set of individuals (because the Y chromosome is a single DNA sequence that is passed down from father to son). In this case, the tree represents time in the \"top-down\" direction: traversing the tree from\u00a0<i>root</i> to\u00a0<i>leaves</i> takes you forward in time. As a result, the\u00a0<i>root</i> node is the most recent common ancestor of the individuals we chose to sequence. Below is an example of such a tree:</p><p><span class=\"image-wrapper\"><img title=\"Image: https://ucarecdn.com/57ab9603-e63f-43d8-be42-84c402cd5274/\" src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/57ab9603-e63f-43d8-be42-84c402cd5274/\" alt=\"\"></span></p><p><b>Unrooted trees</b>\u00a0do not necessarily have an implied hierarchical structure. In some contexts, we might want to interpret an \"inside-out\" hierarchy (i.e., we care about relationships from internal nodes to leaves) or an \"outside-in\" hierarchy (i.e., we care about relationships from leaves to internal nodes). In unrooted trees, instead of thinking of nodes as \"parents\" or \"children,\" it is common to simply think of nodes as \"neighbors\". Also, even if we don't impose any sense of directionality onto the tree, distances between nodes can provide some information of \"closeness\" or \"relatedness\" between them.</p><p>For example, in Bioinformatics, if we want to construct an evolutionary tree from different organisms, if we don't know what the true ancestor was, we have no way of picking a node to be the root. However, the unrooted tree still provides us relational information: leaves closer together on the tree are more similar biologically, and leaves farther apart on the tree are more different biologically.
