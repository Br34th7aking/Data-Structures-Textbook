Recall that we perform this constant-time comparison operation once for each level of the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">BST</span></b>, so as the number of levels in a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">BST</span></b> grows (i.e., the\u00a0<i>height</i> of the <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">BST</span></b> grows), the number of comparison operations we must perform grows proportionally.</p><p>A\u00a0<b>balanced</b> binary tree is one where many (or most) internal nodes have exactly two children.

A\u00a0<i>perfectly unbalanced</i> binary tree is one where\u00a0<i>all</i> internal nodes have exactly one child. The term \"unbalanced\" can be generalized to any\u00a0<i>k</i>-ary tree: an unbalanced <i>k</i>-ary tree is one where many internal nodes have less than\u00a0<i>n</i> children (the more extreme deviation from <i>n</i> children, the more unbalanced the tree).

This equation looks complicated, but the\u00a0log\u2082(n) portion, which is the important part, has some simple intuition behind it: every time you add another level to the bottom of a\u00a0<i>perfectly balanced</i> binary tree, you are roughly doubling the number of elements in the tree. If a tree has one node, adding another row adds 2 nodes. If a tree has 3 nodes, adding another row adds 4 nodes. If a tree has 7 nodes, adding another row adds 8 nodes. Since the height of a\u00a0<i>perfectly balanced</i> binary tree effectively tells you \"how many doublings\" occurred with respect to a one-node\u00a0<i>perfectly balanced</i> binary tree, the number of nodes in the tree would be roughly <i>n</i> =\u00a02<i>\u02b0</i> (where\u00a0<i>h</i> is the height of the tree), so the height of the tree would be roughly\u00a0<i>h</i> = log\u2082(n).</p><p><b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">STOP and Think:</span></b> What previously-discussed data structure does a binary tree transform into when it becomes <i>perfectly unbalanced</i>?<br></p>", "subtitle_files": [], "subtitles": {}, "feedback_wrong": "", "name": "text", "source": null, "options": {}}, "id": "117998", "time": "2016-09-14T00:09:50.663632"}
