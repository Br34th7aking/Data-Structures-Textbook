Now, let's discuss the algorithms for these three operations that are able to\u00a0<i>maintain</i> the\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">AVL Tree</span></b> properties without worsening the time complexity.</p><p>Finding an element in an\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">AVL Tree</span></b> is trivial: it is simply the\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">Binary Search Tree</span></b> \"find\" algorithm, which was discussed in detail in the\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">Binary Search Tree</span></b> section of this text.</p><p>Before discussing the insertion and removal algorithms of an\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">AVL Tree</span></b>, we want to first refresh your memory with regard to a fundamental operation known as the\u00a0<b>AVL Rotation</b>. AVL rotations were introduced previously in the\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Randomized Search Tree</span></b> section of this text, but since they are somewhat non-trivial and are so important to\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">AVL Trees</span></b> (hence the name \"AVL\" rotation), we thought it would be best to review them.</p><p>Recall that\u00a0<b>AVL Rotations</b> can be done in two directions: <b>right</b> or <b>left</b>. Below is a diagram generalizing both right and left AVL Rotations. In the diagram, the triangles represent arbitrary subtrees of any shape: they can be empty, small, large, etc. The circles are the \"important\" nodes upon which we are performing the rotation.</p><p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/b914f856-4d54-4cc1-91f6-4a603a18802f/\" alt=\"\"></p>", "tests_archive": null, "source": null, "subtitle_files": [], "options": {}, "feedback_correct": "", "video": null}, "id": "120394", "time": "2016-09-06T23:44:45.464273"}
