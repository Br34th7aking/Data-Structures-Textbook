As computer scientists, our minds might instinctively jump to \"databases\" or \"data structures,\" but even before we embarked on our journeys through computer science, we should all have hopefully been familiarized with \"lexicons\" (<i>lexicon</i>\ufeff is a fancy word for \"a list of words\") and\u00a0\"dictionaries\" (a list of words with their definitions).</p><p>The oldest known dictionaries are thought to have been created in roughly 2300 BCE. These dictionaries were\u00a0Akkadian Empire cuneiform tablets with translations of words between the Sumerian and Akkadian languages. Ancient dictionaries have been found for many languages around the world, including the Chinese, Greek, Sanskrit, Hindvi, and Arabic languages.</p><p>The earliest dictionaries in the English language were glossaries of French, Spanish, or Latin words along with definitions of the foreign words in English. The English word <i>dictionary</i> was invented by John of Garland in 1220 when he wrote a book, <i>Dictionarius</i>, to help with Latin <i>diction</i>. Throughout the centuries, numerous other English dictionaries were created, but it wasn't until Samuel Johnson wrote\u00a0<i>A Dictionary of the English Language</i>\u00a0in 1755 that a reliable English dictionary was deemed to have been produced.<br></p><p>Now, in the 21st century, dictionaries stored as printed text are becoming less and less popular. When asked about printed dictionaries, a pre-teen cousin of one of the authors had never even used one in the entirety of his life. Instead, online dictionaries, such as those used by services like Google Search or your phone's autocorrect feature, have become the tool of choice. These digital representations of dictionaries are typically able to perform lookups extremely quickly: after searching for a word on Google Search, its definition (and synonyms, and etymology, and statistics about its usage, etc.) are pulled up in approximately half a second.</p><p><span class=\"image-wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/cbca70f2-f273-4d23-a3bb-2b2c14932ef6/\"></span></p><p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><b>Figure:</b> The\u00a0Sumerian\u2013Akkadian dictionary from the\u00a0Mesopotamian city of Elba (now part of Syria) from around 2300 BCE<br></p>", "options": {}, "feedback_correct": "", "source": null, "subtitle_files": [], "name": "text", "feedback_wrong": "", "subtitles": {}, "tests_archive": null, "video": null}}
