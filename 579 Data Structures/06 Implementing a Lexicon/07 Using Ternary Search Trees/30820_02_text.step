Instead, elements stored in a <b>Trie</b>\u00a0are denoted by the concatenation of the labels on the path from the root to the node representing the corresponding element. The\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Ternary Search Tree (TST)</span></b> is a type of trie in which\u00a0nodes are arranged in a manner similar to a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">Binary Search Tree</span></b>,\u00a0but with up to three children rather than the binary tree's limit of two.</p><p>Each node of a <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Ternary Search Tree</span></b> stores a single character from our alphabet\u00a0\u03a3 and can have three children: a\u00a0<i>middle child</i>,\u00a0<i>left child</i>, and\u00a0<i>right child</i>. Further, just like in a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Multiway Trie</span></b>, nodes that represent keys are labeled as \"word nodes\" in some way (for our purposes, we will color them <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">blue</span></b>). Just like in a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">Binary Search Tree</span></b>, for every node\u00a0<i>u</i>, the\u00a0<i>left child</i> of\u00a0<i>u</i> must have a value\u00a0<i>less than u</i>, and the\u00a0<i>right child</i> of\u00a0<i>u</i> must have a value\u00a0<i>greater than u</i>. The\u00a0<i>middle child</i> of\u00a0<i>u</i> represents the next character in the current word.<br></p><p>In a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Multiway Trie</span></b>, a word was defined as the concatenation of labels along the path from the root to a \"word node.\" In a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Ternary Search Tree</span></b>, the definition of a word is a bit more complicated. For a given \"word node\"\u00a0<i>u</i>, define the path from the root to\u00a0<i>u</i> as\u00a0<i>path</i>, and define\u00a0<i>S</i> as the set of all nodes\u00a0<i>v</i> in\u00a0<i>path</i> where we traversed from\u00a0<i>v</i> to the\u00a0<i>middle child</i> of\u00a0<i>v</i>. The word represented by\u00a0<i>u</i> is defined as the concatenation of the labels of each node\u00a0<i>v</i> in\u00a0<i>S</i>, along with the label of\u00a0<i>u</i>.</p><p>Below is an example of a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Ternary Search Tree</span></b> that contains the words \"call,\" \"me,\" \"mind,\" and \"mid\":</p><p><span class=\"image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/1349d75d-a32c-4ccb-b4ba-dffe57cb3067/\"></span></p><p>If it is unclear to you\u00a0<i>how</i> this example stores the words we listed above, as well as how to go about finding an arbitrary query word, that is perfectly fine.
