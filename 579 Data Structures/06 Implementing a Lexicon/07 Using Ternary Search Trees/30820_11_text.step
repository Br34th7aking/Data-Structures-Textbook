As a result, just like in a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Multiway Trie</span></b>, we can iterate through the elements of a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Ternary Search Tree</span></b> in sorted order by performing a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">pre-order traversal</span></b>\u00a0on the trie.
