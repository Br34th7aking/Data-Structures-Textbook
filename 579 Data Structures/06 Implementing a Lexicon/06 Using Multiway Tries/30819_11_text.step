However, with this approach, it would be impossible for us to iterate through the words in the lexicon in any meaningful order.</p><p>In this chapter, we have now discussed using a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Multiway Trie</span></b> to implement a lexicon, which allows us to perform find, insert, and remove operations with a\u00a0<b>worst-case time complexity</b> of\u00a0<b>O(<i>k</i>)</b>. Also, because of the structure of a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Multiway Trie</span></b>, we can easily and efficiently iterate through the words in the lexicon in alphabetical order (either ascending or descending order) by performing a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">pre-order traversal</span></b>. We can use this exact\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">pre-order traversal</span></b> technique to create\u00a0<b>auto-complete</b> functionality for our lexicon.</p><p>However,\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Multiway Tries</span></b> are\u00a0<i>extremely</i> inefficient in terms of\u00a0<b>space usage</b>: in order to have fast access to edges coming out of a given node <i>u</i>, we need to allocate space for each of the |\u03a3| possible edges that could theoretically come out of\u00a0<i>u</i>. If our trie is relatively dense, this space usage is tolerable, but if our trie is relatively sparse, there will be a\u00a0<i>lot</i> of space wasted in terms of empty space for possible edges.</p><p>In the next section, we will discuss a data structure that lets us obtain\u00a0<i>close</i> to the great time efficiency of a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Multiway Trie</span></b>, but without the terrible space efficiency: the\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">Ternary Search Tree</span></b>.</p>", "options": {}, "subtitle_files": [], "name": "text", "video": null, "feedback_wrong": ""}, "id": "121893"}
