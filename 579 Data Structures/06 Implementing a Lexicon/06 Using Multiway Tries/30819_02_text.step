The elements stored in a\u00a0<b>Trie</b> are denoted by the concatenation of the edge labels on the path from the root to the node representing the corresponding element. Nodes that represent keys are labeled as \"word nodes\" in some way (for our purposes, we will color them\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">blue</span></b>).</p><p>Below is an example of a\u00a0<b>Trie</b>. Specifically, it is an example of a\u00a0<b>Binary Trie</b>: a\u00a0<b>Trie</b> that is a binary tree.\u00a0The words stored in the <b>Trie</b>\u00a0below are denoted by the prefixes leading up to all <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">blue</span></b>\u00a0nodes: 0, 00, 10, and 11. Note that 01 is not in this trie because there is no valid path from the root labeled by 01, and also note that 1 is not in this trie because, although there is a valid path from the root labeled by 1, the node that we end up at is not a \"word node.\"</p><p></p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/0dd7fffb-2dfa-4547-addd-0ce4626c2714/\"></p><p>Of course, as humans, we don't speak in binary, so it would be helpful for our data structure to be able to represent words in our own alphabet. Instead of having only two edges coming out of each node (labeled with either a 1 or a 0), we can expand our alphabet to any alphabet we choose! A\u00a0<b>Trie</b> in which nodes can have more than two edges are known as\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Multiway Tries</span></b>. For our purposes, we will use\u00a0\u03a3 to denote our alphabet. For example, for binary,\u00a0\u03a3 = {0,1}. For the DNA alphabet,\u00a0\u03a3 = {A, C, G, T}. For the English alphabet,\u00a0\u03a3 = {a, ..., z}.</p><p>Below is a\u00a0<b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">Multiway Trie</span></b> with \u03a3 = {a, ..., z}\u00a0containing the following words: <i>can</i>,\u00a0<i>car</i>, and\u00a0<i>cry</i>.</p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/696f3b7c-2d01-49b2-98dc-38aa7abf1c9a/\" title=\"Image: https://ucarecdn.com/696f3b7c-2d01-49b2-98dc-38aa7abf1c9a/\"></p>", "tests_archive": null, "source": null, "subtitle_files": [], "options": {}, "feedback_correct": "", "video": null}, "id": "121737", "time": "2016-09-06T23:48:58.517236"}
