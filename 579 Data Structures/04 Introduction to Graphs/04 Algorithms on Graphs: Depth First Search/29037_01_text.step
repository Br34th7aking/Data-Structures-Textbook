Let's look at the same graph we looked at when we introduced BFS in the last lesson:</p><p><span class=\"image-wrapper\"><img title=\"Image: https://ucarecdn.com/a7e2c9fe-eda3-4ace-b409-10d4616b158f/\" src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/a7e2c9fe-eda3-4ace-b409-10d4616b158f/\"></span></p><p><span></span></p><p>Suppose\n we start at 0. <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">DFS</span></b> will then choose to \"visit\" 1, since it is \nimmediately reachable from 0. From 1, <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">DFS</span></b> can choose to \"visit\" either 3 <i>or </i>4 since they are <i>both</i> immediately reachable from 1. Suppose <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\"><b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">DFS</span></b></span> chooses to visit 3; after, <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">DFS</span></b> will \"visit\" 2 as it reachable from 3. <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\"><b>DFS</b> </span>will finish by visiting 4 since it is immediately reachable from 2. Notice that the <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\"><b>DFS</b></span> algorithm chooses to explore 4 last, as opposed to 2 like in BFS.</p><p>It is important to note that <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">DFS </span></b>could have chosen to explore 4 instead of 3 (0 \u2192 1 \u2192 4). You may notice that, in this case, 4 would not have any more immediately reachable vertex to explore, yet we would still have some unexplored vertices left. As a result, <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">DFS</span></b> would choose to explore an \"unvisited\" vertex reachable from the most recent explored vertex (1). In this case, DFS would then choose 3, as it is the next immediately reachable vertex from 1.</p><p><span></span></p><div><p></p><p>The rough algorithm for <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">DFS</span></b> can be thought of as:<br></p><p></p><ol><li>Start at<i> s</i>. It has distance 0 from itself.\n</li><li>Consider a node adjacent to <i>s</i>. Call it <i>t</i>. It has distance 1. Mark it as visited.\n</li><li>Then consider a node adjacent to\u00a0<i>t</i> that has not yet been visited. It has distance 2. Mark it as visited.\n</li><li>Etc. etc. until all nodes reachable from <i>s</i>\ufeff\u00a0are visited.</li></ol></div>", "tests_archive": null, "source": null, "subtitle_files": [], "options": {}, "feedback_correct": "", "video": null}, "id": "116285", "time": "2016-09-06T23:45:48.132189"}
