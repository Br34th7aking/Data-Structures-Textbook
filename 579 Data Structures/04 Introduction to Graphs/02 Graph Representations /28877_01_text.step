Consequently, it is a good idea to consider the properties of the graph you are dealing with to make the best decision on how to go about representing it. <br></p><p>One good way to quantify the shape and size of a graph is to compare the number of edges in the graph, |<i>E</i>|,\u00a0to the number of vertices in the graph, |<i>V</i>|.</p><p>Suppose a graph has <b></b>|<i><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">V</span></i>|<b></b> <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">vertices</span>. How many possible edges could the graph have? We know that, at minimum, the graph could just look like a \"forest\" of isolated\u00a0vertices, and as a result, it would have no edges (<b></b><b>|</b><i><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\"><b>E</b></span></i><b>|</b><b></b><b> = 0</b>). Can we calculate an upper-bound on the number of edges? For our purposes, as mentioned in the previous section of the text, we will disallow \"multigraphs\" (i.e., we are\u00a0disallowing \"parallel edges\": multiple edges with the same start and end node). Suppose that our first vertex is connected to every other vertex in the graph (including itself). That means that we would have <b></b>|<i><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">V</span></i>|<b></b> edges coming from that single vertex. Now, suppose we had the same for <i>all</i> vertices\u00a0in the graph, not just the first one. All <b></b>|<i><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">V</span></i>|<b></b> of our vertices would have exactly <b></b>|<i><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">V</span></i>|<b></b> edges (one to each vertex, including itself), resulting in <b>|</b><i><b>E</b></i><b>| =\u00a0</b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\"><b>|</b></span><i><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\"><b>V</b></span></i><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\"><b>| * |</b></span><i><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\"><b>V</b></span></i><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\"><b>| = |</b></span><i><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\"><b>V</b></span></i><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\"><b>|\u00b2</b></span><b></b>  edges.<br></p><p>We like to use the word <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\">dense</span></b> to describe graphs with many edges (close to our upper-bound of <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">|</span><b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\"><i><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">V</span></i></span></b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">|</span><b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\">\u00b2</span></b> edges for our purposes), such as the one below:</p><p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/09db733e-329a-4722-ad92-40fed2cdc9b1/\" alt=\"\"></p><p> We like to use the word <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">sparse</span></b> to describe graphs with few edges (significantly fewer than <b></b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\"><b>|</b></span><i><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\"><b>V</b></span></i><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-black\"><b>|\u00b2</b></span><b></b> edges for our purposes), such as the one below:</p><p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/4ebfd0cf-0533-44d6-a497-ef11db4c0924/\" alt=\"\"></p>", "feedback_correct": "", "tests_archive": null, "subtitles": {}, "source": null, "name": "text", "video": null, "feedback_wrong": "", "options": {}, "animation": null}}
