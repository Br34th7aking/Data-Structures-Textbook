As a result, we need a formal mathematical definition of a \"graph\". Specifically, we choose to formally represent a graph <i><b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green\">G</span></b></i><b> = (</b><i><b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">V</span></b></i><b>, </b><i><b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">E</span></b></i><b>)</b>, where <i><b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\">V</span></b> </i>is the set of <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-purple\"><b>vertices</b></span> in <i>G</i> and<i> <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">E</span></b></i> is the set of <b><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-blue\">edges</span></b> in <i>G</i>.</p><p>Formally, we represent edge\u00a0<i>e</i>\u00a0as a pair (<i>v</i>,\u00a0<i>w</i>) such that both <i>v</i> and <i>w</i> are vertices. For example, <i>e</i>\u2081<i></i> in the graph below would be written as (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>).</p><p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/7f8f43a0-48c2-4cfe-b2b0-1e7b7fe26057/\" alt=\"\"></p><p>For an arbitrary graph <i>G</i>, the set <i>V</i> follows the intuitive notion of a \"set\" in that each vertex in <i>V</i> is unique. However, note that the set <i>E</i> is not necessarily as intuitive: there can exist multiple equivalent edges connecting the same two vertices <i>v</i> and <i>w</i>. An example of such graph, known as a <b>multigraph</b>, can be found below, in which we have three edges connecting vertices <i>a</i> and\u00a0<i>\ufeffb</i>:</p><p><img src=\"https://ucarecdn.com/f0b22225-0c9c-4d6c-b440-7ec7f3f255cc/\" alt=\"\"></p><p>However, for the purpose of this text, we will ignore the possibility of multigraphs and operate under the \nassumption that we can have at most one edge connecting two given vertices.</p><p>It is also useful to know that, when talking about the sizes of graphs, |<i>V</i>|\n represents the total number of vertices and |<i>E</i>| represents the total number of \nedges. In the first example graph above, |<i>V</i>| = 2 (because there are two vertices: <i>a</i> and\u00a0<i>b</i>)\u00a0and |<i>E</i>| = 1 (because there is only a single edge, one that connects <i>a</i> and\u00a0<i>b</i>).<br></p>", "subtitle_files": [], "subtitles": {}, "feedback_wrong": "", "name": "text", "source": null, "options": {}}, "id": "109921", "time": "2016-09-14T00:10:57.961979"}
