You don't want to simply capture Chuck: he might be innocent, and more importantly, if he isn't innocent, you might be able to gain valuable intel regarding anyone else who may have been involved in stealing the\u00a0<i>Intersect</i> if you track Chuck and his social circle.</p><p>Chuck lives with his sister, Ellie Bartowski, and her boyfriend, Devon Woodcomb. Chuck often hangs out with his best friend, Morgan Grimes, and they both work at the Burbank Buy More store, where they frequently interact with their co-workers \"Big Mike\", Lester Patel, Jeff Barnes, and Anna Wu.</p><p>Each of these connections has a social circle as well, and the people in those social circles have social circles, etc., so it is clear that we can map the scenario as a graph: nodes (<i>V</i>)\u00a0are individuals, and edges (<i>E</i>) represent individuals having a direct social connection to one another. Sarah's goal is to come up with a way of being able to query a person's name and determine if the person is connected to Chuck, either directly or indirectly. If she were to approach this as a naive graph traversal algorithm, she would need to use BFS each time she performs a query, which is O(|<i>V</i>| + |<i>E</i>|). Luckily, Sarah did well in her university Data Structures course, and as a result, she had the Computer Science skills needed to solve the seemingly complex problem quite efficiently.</p><p>In this section, we will discuss the\u00a0<b>Disjoint Set</b>\ufeff ADT, which will help Sarah greatly speed up her surveillance problem.</p>", "feedback_correct": "", "tests_archive": null, "subtitle_files": [], "name": "text"}, "time": "2016-09-03T01:10:29.397243"}
